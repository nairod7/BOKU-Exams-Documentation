Question
========

*Questions 1*

What is the atomic number of hydrogen in the periodic table?
##ANSWER1##

*Question 2*

Calculate the molar mass of water ($H_2O$). Use the following molar masses:

- Hydrogen ($H$): `r m_h` $g/mol$

- Oxygen ($O$): `r m_o` $g/mol$

Provide your answer in grams per mole ($g/mol$).
##ANSWER2##

```{r questionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis", results = "hide"}
answerlist(unlist(answers), markup = "markdown")
```

Solution
========
```{r solutionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(unlist(explanations), markup = "markdown")
```

$M_{H_{2}O} = 2 \cdot M_H + M_O = 2 \cdot `r m_h` + `r m_o` = `r m_h2o`$ (g/mol)
