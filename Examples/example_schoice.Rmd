Question
========

*Questions 1*

What does the term "molar mass" refer to?

##ANSWER1##

*Question 2*

Which of the following is the lightest element?

##ANSWER2##

```{r questionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(unlist(answers), markup = "markdown")

```

Solution
========

*Solution 1*

The molar mass is the mass of one mole of a substance, expressed in grams per mole (g/mol).

*Solution 2*

Hydrogen is the lightest element, with an atomic mass of approximately 1 g/mol.


```{r solutionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
# Convert solutions to "True" or "False"
explanations <- lapply(solutions, function(x) ifelse(x, "True", "False"))
solutions <- lapply(solutions, mchoice2string)

# Display explanations
answerlist(unlist(explanations), markup = "markdown")

```
