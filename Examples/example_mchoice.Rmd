Question
========

*Questions 1*

Which of the following elements are metals?

##ANSWER1##

*Question 2*

Which of the following elements are metalloids?

##ANSWER2##

```{r questionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(unlist(answers), markup = "markdown")

```

Solution
========

*Solution 1*

Iron (Fe) and Aluminium (Al) are metals, while Oxygen (O) and Nitrogen (N) are gases.

*Solution 2*

Silicon (Si), Boron (B), and Arsenic (As) are metalloids. Helium (He) is a noble gas.


```{r solutionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
# Convert solutions to "True" or "False"
explanations <- lapply(solutions, function(x) ifelse(x, "True", "False"))
solutions <- lapply(solutions, mchoice2string)

# Display explanations
answerlist(unlist(explanations), markup = "markdown")

```
