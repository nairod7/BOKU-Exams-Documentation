    "text": "Data Generation\nIn this section of the .Rmd-file, the questions (including answer options for single/multiple choice questions), solutions, the types of questions, explanations and tolerances for solutions are created and stored in list objects for later. In addition there are many additional possibilities, like sampling data, creating graphs, importing pictures etc. which will be discussed later (See section ???????)\n\nDescription of the lists\nThe five necessary lists are questions, solutions, types, explanations and tolerances, which all have the same length, which is equal to the number of questions in the exercise. For example, in an exercise with 5 multiple choice questions, the length of the lists is 5.\nDepending on the type and simplicity of the question, some of the lists might not be necessary. (see ??????)\nThe list questions contains the answer options for single choice/multiple choice questions, not the questions itself. The actual questions are written down in the section “Question”. For numeric and string questions, this list contains placeholders ““, since no answer options are given. (more on the types of questios see ??????)\nThe list solutions contains the solutions for all the questions. For numeric questions, that is a number, (e.g: 123), for string questions a string like \"hello world\" is expected. The solution for single & multiple choiche questions is a boolean vector containing TRUE/FALSE. For each answer option, one instance of TRUE or FALSE is needed. For example, a multiple choice question with 5 answer options, where one option (in this case the second answer option) is correct, would have a solution vector like this:\nc(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)\nThe list types specifies the type of question for each individual question. Possible values are\n\nnumeric (“num”)\nstring (“string”)\nsingle choice (“schoice”)\nmultiple choice (“mchoice”)\n\nThe list explanations contains the feedback that is shown. This can be the complete solutions or additional information like the seed, that was used to create this exercise, session info, etc.\nThe list tolerances is only necessary for numeric questions, where it is desired to have an interval, in which the solution is accepted as correct, even though the numbers are not perfectly equal. This is important for accommodating rounding differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nCareful when random generating numbers and setting an (absolute) tolerance interval that is too narrow, then the true solution could lie outside of the tolerance interval.\n\n\n\n\nCreating the lists\nThey are initailized as empty lists, which are later filled with the desired information via subsetting. see ?????\nquestions &lt;- list() \nsolutions &lt;- list() \ntypes &lt;- list()\nexplanations &lt;- list() \ntolerances &lt;- list()",

    "text": "MetaInformation\nTo create exercises with the R/exams package, it’s necessary to define specific properties for each exercise. These properties help Moodle to interpret and display the exercises correctly. Below are the essential fields for the MetaInformation section, along with explanations and dynamic R code for setting them up:\n\nexname: Exercise Name\n\nPurpose: A unique identifier for each exercise. This helps manage and retrieve exercises easily from an exercise pool.\n\nexname: \"basic_statistics_01\"\n\n\nextitle: Exercise Title\n\nPurpose: specifies the exercise’s title, providing a clear identifier that appears in Moodle, exported files, and reports.\n\nextitle: \"basic_statistics_01{story_name}\"\n\n\nextype: Exercise Type\n\nPurpose: Specifies the type of exercise. Since we often use mixed question types, the cloze type is commonly used.\n\nextype: cloze\n\n\nexsolution: Solution of Each Part\n\nPurpose: Defines the correct solutions to the exercise. Since in our exercises mostly multiple answers are needed, the different solutions are separated by |.\n\nExample:\nexsolution: 42|TRUE|FALSE, TRUE\n\n\nexclozetypes: Cloze Subtypes for Each Part\n\nPurpose: When using cloze types, define each subtype for the cloze questions based on the types list. If cloze type isn’t used, this parameter is not needed\n\nExample:\nexclozetypes: num|schoice|mchoice\n\n\nextol: Tolerance Levels for Numeric Answers\n\nPurpose: Defines acceptable tolerances for numeric answers, useful for cloze questions with numeric solutions.\n\nExample:\nextol: 1|0|0\n\n\nPutting It Togheter and Dynamic Embedding\nHere you can see an example of all the needed keyparameter put togheter. Since we have all our needed informations for exsolutions, exclozetype and extol in our lists created in the Data Generation Step, we can also just access them dynamically by by embedding R code within backticks:\n\nexname: name of the exercise\nextitle: titel of the exercise\nextype: cloze\nexsolution: `r paste(solutions, collapse = \"|\")`\nexclozetype: `r paste(types, collapse = \"|\")`\nextol: `r paste(tolerances, collapse = \"|\")`",
